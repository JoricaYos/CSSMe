            <h4>About me</h4>
            <h1>My Life Story</h1><br>
            <p>Being the eldest daughter in our family, I've shouldered both the joys and challenges that come with responsibility from a young age. </p><br>
            <p>Growing up without a father, his presence was deeply missed, but his memory serves as a guiding light in my journey. While he may be in God's hands, his values of strength, resilience, and love continue to shape who I am today. </p><br>
            <p>
                Navigating through life's twists and turns has taught me invaluable lessons in perseverance, empathy, and the power of familial bonds. As a BSIT student, I bring this unique perspective to my studies, infusing my work with compassion and determination. Join me as I blend my technical expertise with the warmth and understanding cultivated from my life experiences, striving to make a positive impact in both the digital realm and the world around me

            <h1>My Hobbies:</h1><br>
                <p> Dancing and singing have always been my favorite pastimes. Dancing is my passion since it brings me joy to do various steps. Additionally, I used to enjoy teaching my primary school friends some dancing moves during school occasions. I also enjoy singing, even though I don't have a great voice. Singing helps me relax and feels good. </p>
